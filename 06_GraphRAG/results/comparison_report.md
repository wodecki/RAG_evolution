## Answer Quality Assessment

**Specificity:** GraphRAG provided more specific answers in 0/7 queries

**Interpretability:** GraphRAG provides Cypher queries for transparency, Naive RAG relies on semantic similarity

## Key Findings

### GraphRAG Advantages:
1. **Exact Counting:** Provides precise counts through graph traversal
2. **Complex Filtering:** Multi-criteria filtering with relationship properties
3. **Aggregations:** Direct mathematical operations on graph data
4. **Multi-hop Reasoning:** Complex relationship traversals impossible for vector search
5. **Temporal Logic:** Precise date-based filtering and arithmetic
6. **Transparency:** Cypher queries show exact reasoning path

### Naive RAG Strengths:
1. **Semantic Similarity:** Good for fuzzy text matching
2. **Setup Simplicity:** Easier to implement for basic use cases
3. **Flexibility:** Handles diverse query types without schema knowledge

### Use Case Recommendations:

**Use GraphRAG for:**
- Structured data with clear relationships
- Counting, aggregation, and ranking queries
- Multi-criteria filtering
- Temporal reasoning
- Complex business logic

**Use Naive RAG for:**
- Unstructured text search
- Semantic similarity queries
- Simple question-answering
- Rapid prototyping
